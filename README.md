CHESS PROJECT

This repository contain my personal version of the game Chess. 
I implemented all and only the Official chess rules (en passant and castling included). There is no time constraint nor anyway to apply a time constraint.
This version is playable only on terminal. 
(some terminal may not support the colored texts... I have no idea how to fix it, i advice to change the code where i implement the color.hpp library -> all printing functions)
